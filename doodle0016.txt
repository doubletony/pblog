Title: cling - An interactive C++ interpreter
Author: doubletony

## I literally understand the title, so what's that?

Well, I like [python](http://python.org/ ) 's interactive programming environment. It makes things easier. 
For example, testing a simple piece of code or playing with a module to get familiar with it. So how about C++? It's kind of
tedious to write a .cpp file and then compile it to run. If something does not work as what I expected, I need
change the code and repeat the above procedure again and again. It seems not bearable for a lazy one like me.

Then I searched around and finally found [cling](http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/what-cling ).

## Just a snapshot

After the long wait of building, making and installing, I finally get it worked pretty nicely. Here 
is just a snapshot to show (off) :)

## Comments

1. It's still a bit tedious. I have to type "#include <iostream>" stuff every time I launch cling. Maybe there is a hack
to include some head files as default.

2. Laggy. It may due to my poor *ATT* connection, but cling is a bit slow. Well, it's not that scaring.

3. Future comments reserved.
