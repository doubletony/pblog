## Note for *doubletony* in future

First make sure you are under the right path (PATH-to-pblog/, not under this directory where this note belongs to).

1. To check whether you have unpublished working blog, run
```bash
./showworking.py
```

2. To create a blog, run
```bash
./newDoodle.py
```

3. To publish (regenrate the index.html), run
```bash
python pueblo.py
```
