## Never too old to learn

Today, I did a presentation about [linear solvers on GPU](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~wangyua6/presentation/gpusolver.html ). I'm not gonna babble what I talked on this topic. The process of making this presentation is much more interesting.

So, to make the slides for this presentation, I tried a new tool - [weakpoint](http://github.com/onesuper/weakpoint ),
which I was looking for for a while. And it's also a fun experience to learn how to play with [github](http://github.com/ ). One "side effect" is that it forces me to pick up my "hobby" of [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ ).
