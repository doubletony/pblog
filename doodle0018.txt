It's original posted on my another [blog](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~wangyua6/blog/?p=1738) in Chinese. 

# Motivation

The recent update of Chrome is nice to me. It will open PDF link with [Google Document](http://docs.google.com). 
However, sometimes, it's just not working that well. I searched a while on Google's extension store but no luck
there. Finally, I decide to create a such extension since it's not very hard to implement.  Actually, it's very
simple. I have no exprience of developing Chorme extenstion before. It just took me about 30 mintues to read the
Document and around 10 mintues to write up the extension. Yeah, I'm kind of showing off :)
