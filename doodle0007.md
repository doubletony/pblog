## The Art of War

First of all, I'm a pacifist. And actually, Sun Tzu is also a pacifist in some sense. He said,

> "
> 凡用兵之法：全國為上，破國次之。全軍為上，破軍次之。全旅為上，破旅次之。全卒為上，破卒次之。全伍為上，破伍次之。是故，百戰百勝，非善之善者也；不戰而勝，善之善者也。
> "

> "
> In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.
> Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
> "
