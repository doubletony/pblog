## Oops...

Last Tuesday, my tablet slipped into ground, and the screen was broken, literally.

Unfortunately, our university compute store doesn't have any service for Samsung tablets.
The place the computer store guy recommended may charge more than 150 bucks.
Well, after Bing-ing a while, I decided to fix it by myself. The cost is really cheap, less than 30 bucks for the screen digitizer, and one hour (as estimated) according to the following video.
