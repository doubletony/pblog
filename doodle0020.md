## What is three.js?

I'm not a good story teller. More details on the project [page](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/ ) on GitHub. 
Briefly, it's a javascript library providing html 3D renderers.

## Show me some demos?

Here are a bunch of [demos](http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/ ).

## My poor one.

Credit to [creative JS](http://creativejs.com/tutorials/three-js-part-1-make-a-star-field/ ). I simply modified this
demo by adding random color. [Enjoy](http://www.egr.msu.edu/~wangyua6/demo/ ) it if you're not satisfied with any demo above.
