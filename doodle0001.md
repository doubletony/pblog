## Purpose

Since I've spent some time on building up this new blog, it's a good
opportunity to hone my skills on writing in English. 

## Self requirement

I'd like to make it a bit seriously. Thus, some requirements are
necessary and here are three off the top of my head:

1. ***Try*** to keep writing daily
2. Topic may ***not*** be restricted within technology
3. Get it done within ***one hour***
