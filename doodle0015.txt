Title: Binary trees and triangle dissections
Author: doubletony
Date:  9 August 2012

## What's the problem?

Actually, the following problem is from the epic book - [The Art of Computer Programming](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/taocp.html). 

> Find a simple one-to-one correspondence between binary trees with $n$ nodes and 
> dissections of an $(n+2)$-sided convex polygon into $n$ triangles, assuming that
> the sides of the polygon are distinct.


## Solution ?

I yield to write the solution here since TAOCP does have solution. So, the hint is
Can you find the relation between the following stuff and a binary tree?


$$ (((12) 3) 4)  $$
