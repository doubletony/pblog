## What recalls me?

Occasionally, I found [this video](www.yinyuetai.com/video/42613 ).

## My comment

Yeah, it's been quite a while since last time I played basketball. Like most 80s "young" people, I was impacted a lot by the popular cartoon [Slam Dunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk ). I can still remember the golden old time when I save my allowance for breakfast to collect the complete comics. This video recalls me so much memory about childhood and teenager. Just a blink, I'm a graduate student now and working on "Permanent head damage". Anyway, it's not good to always live in yeasterday, since Einsten said:

*Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.*
